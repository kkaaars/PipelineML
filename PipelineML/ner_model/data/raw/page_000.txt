What is a bed frame?
A bed frame is a piece of furniture that serves as a foundation for a bed. It is designed to support the mattress, elevate it off the ground, and provide stability to the entire bed structure. Bed frames come in various materials, such as wood, metal, or upholstered, and styles ranging from simple and minimalistic to elaborate and ornate. Some bed frames also feature additional storage options, such as drawers or shelves, while others are adjustable to accommodate different mattress sizes. Bed frames are an essential component of any bedroom, as they not only provide a functional support system for sleeping but also contribute to the room's overall aesthetic.
Does a bed frame affect the mattress?
Yes, a bed frame can affect the mattress in a few different ways. Firstly, a proper bed frame is necessary to support the weight of the mattress and the people sleeping on it, preventing sagging or sinking. A poor quality or worn-out bed frame can lead to an uneven surface and poor sleeping posture. Secondly, the type of bed frame can also impact the overall comfort and feel of the mattress. For instance, a slatted frame with wider gaps can cause a mattress to sag or feel less supportive, while a solid foundation or box spring can provide a firmer base. Ultimately, choosing the right bed frame for a mattress can enhance its lifespan, improve sleeping posture, and provide optimal comfort.
Are bed frames important?
Yes, bed frames are important for several reasons. Firstly, they provide a sturdy and stable foundation for the mattress, preventing sagging or damage to the bed. Secondly, a bed frame elevates the mattress off the floor, reducing the risk of dirt, dust, and other allergens accumulating on the surface. Additionally, bed frames can also enhance the overall aesthetic of a room, adding a sense of style and sophistication. Some bed frames even offer additional features, such as storage options, making them a practical choice for those with limited space. Overall, bed frames are an essential component of a comfortable and well-designed bedroom.
How do you choose the right bed frame?
When choosing the right bed frame, there are several factors to consider. Firstly, the size of the bed frame should match the size of the mattress for optimal support and comfort. Secondly, the material and style of the bed frame should complement the room's décor and personal taste. Additionally, bed frames with added features such as storage options can be beneficial for those with limited space. Factory Buys offers a wide range of high-quality and affordable bed frames to choose from, making it easy to find the perfect fit for any bedroom. With their great value and variety of styles, Factory Buys bed frames are a smart choice for anyone looking for a reliable and stylish bed frame.
How do you clean the fabric of a bed frame?
Here are some steps to follow when cleaning the fabric of a bed frame:
Remove any excess dirt or dust using a soft-bristled brush or vacuum cleaner.
Check the manufacturer's instructions for any specific cleaning recommendations.
Use a fabric cleaner or mild detergent mixed with warm water to spot-clean any stains.
Dab the fabric with a clean cloth or sponge, avoiding excessive rubbing.
Rinse the area with a damp cloth, removing any excess soap or cleaner.
Let the fabric air dry completely before using the bed frame again.
It's important to avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, which can damage the fabric. By following these steps, you can keep your bed frame looking clean and well-maintained.
What sized bed frames are available?
Factory Buys offers a wide range of bed frames in various sizes to suit different mattress sizes and room dimensions. Their selection includes:
Single bed frames (92cm x 188cm)
King single bed frames (107cm x 203cm)
Double bed frames (138cm x 188cm)

How long does a mattress last?
The lifespan of a mattress depends on a number of factors, such as the quality of materials used, the level of usage, and the care taken. In general, a good quality mattress should last between 7-10 years, but this can vary depending on the above factors.
To ensure the longevity of your mattress, it's important to follow the care instructions provided and rotate your mattress regularly. Also, use a good quality mattress protector every time to keep your mattress looking and feeling its best.
At Factory Buys, we offer a wide range of cheap mattresses that are made from high-quality materials and designed to provide a restful and comfortable night's sleep, so you can enjoy a great night's sleep for years to come.
How do I choose the right mattress?
Choosing the right mattress can make all the difference in getting a restful and comfortable night's sleep. If you’re new to buying mattresses online or overwhelmed by the different terms and options, Factory Buys make it easier for you by including a glossary to help you make sense of all things mattress-related!
Start by determining your preferred level of firmness, which will depend on your individual comfort level and sleeping habits. If you tend to sleep on your back, a medium-firm mattress may be the best choice, while side sleepers may benefit from a softer mattress.
In addition, consider the size of the mattress, as well as the quality of materials and construction. At Factory Buys, we offer a wide range of affordable mattresses that are made from high-quality materials and designed to provide a comfortable and restful night's sleep.
Our friendly and knowledgeable customer service team is also available to answer any questions you may have about our mattress selection or the ordering process, so you can be sure you're making the right choice for your needs and budget.
What types of mattresses are available at Factory Buys?

With flexible payment options like Afterpay and ZipPay, you can enjoy the benefits of a high-quality mattress without breaking the bank. Shop our range of mattresses online and have them delivered straight to your door.
How do you take care of a mattress?
Proper care and maintenance of your mattress can help to extend its lifespan and ensure that you continue to get a restful night's sleep for years to come. Here are some steps to take care of your mattress:
Rotate your mattress regularly: This will prevent the mattress from developing permanent indentations, ensuring that it lasts longer.
Protect your mattress: Use a mattress protector to protect your mattress from spills and stains.
Clean your mattress: Use a vacuum cleaner to remove dust and dirt from your mattress. You can also spot clean with a gentle detergent and warm water, but make sure not to soak the mattress.
Air out your mattress: Open windows or doors to allow fresh air to circulate around the mattress, which can help to reduce odours and mildew.
Don't jump on the bed: As tempting as this may be, this can cause damage to the mattress and decrease its lifespan.
Avoid sharp objects: Keep sharp objects away from your bedding and mattress to avoid nicks, tears and pulls that can damage and reduce the lifespan of your mattress. Take extra care when unpacking your new mattress, especially if you’ve purchased a mattress in a box - while it may be tempting to use a sharp object to open up the packaging, you risk serious injury to yourself and to your new mattress. Also, you may have issues with voiding your warranty if you damage the mattress while unpacking it.
By following these simple steps, you can ensure that your mattress stays in good condition and provides you with a comfortable and restful night's sleep for years to come.
What mattress accessories do I need?
At Factory Buys, we offer a range of mattress accessories to enhance your sleeping experience. A mattress protector can help to protect your mattress from spills and stains, while also creating a barrier against allergens and dust mites. Mattress toppers can add an extra layer of comfort to your mattress, providing additional support and cushioning. Pillows are also important to ensure a comfortable and restful sleep, and we offer a range of pillows in different materials and levels of firmness to suit different sleeping positions and preferences. Finally, a good quality bed frame can help to support your mattress and extend its lifespan, while also adding a stylish touch to your bedroom. Shop our range of mattress accessories to enhance your sleeping experience today.
How Do I Decide Which Mattress Is Best for My Sleeping Type?
Before looking to buy your new mattress online, knowing how you sleep and understanding the link between your sleeping preference and your mattress is very important. Choosing a mattress that works best with your sleeping style can make all the difference in enjoying a comfortable and restful night’s sleep.
Here are some tips on mattress choice, based on your sleeping type:
Side sleepers: Memory foam or softer hybrid mattresses with soft to medium-firm work best. This combination will reduce pressure points on your body.
Back sleepers: Medium-firm to firm mattresses with inner springs are your best bet. You’ll have good back support while the mattress supports the natural curve of your spine.
Stomach sleepers: Firmer mattresses are a must have feature you’ll need in your new mattress. A firm mattress will give your hips and lower back enough support to keep you comfortable and supported.
You should also consider other factors from your online mattress purchase such as breathability for hot sleepers, and hypoallergenic materials like latex or memory foam to resist dust mites and allergens.
No matter what your sleeping style is, Factory Buys has your online cheap mattress needs covered!
How Can I Discover More About My Mattress Needs?
Choosing and buying your new mattress online is easier with Factory Buys’ information guides. Whether you need more information on mattress firmness, mattress style and even accessories like mattress toppers and protectors, we’ve got you covered.

Leather is a popular choice for sofas and chairs because of its durability, timeless look, and easy-to-clean nature.
Fabric is also a good option, offering a wide variety of colours and patterns, and it is generally at a more affordable price.
Wood is another classic material, providing sturdy and long-lasting options for tables and storage units.
Metal is a sleek and modern choice for tables and chairs, but it may not be as comfortable as other materials.
Natural materials such as bamboo and rattan are also becoming increasingly popular, offering an eco-friendly and stylish option.
Ultimately, the best material for your living room furniture depends on your personal style, lifestyle, and budget.
What Living Room Furniture Styles Can I Pick From?
There are many different lounge room furniture styles to choose from, each with its own unique characteristics and aesthetic. Some popular living room furniture styles include traditional, modern, transitional, coastal, and farmhouse.
Traditional style furniture often features intricate details, elegant curves, and rich finishes, while modern style furniture is more minimalist and streamlined with clean lines and neutral colours.
Transitional style blends traditional and modern elements, offering a comfortable and relaxed look.
Coastal style is inspired by the beach and ocean, featuring light colours, natural textures, and nautical accents.
Farmhouse style furniture is rustic and cosy, featuring distressed finishes, vintage-inspired pieces, and natural materials.
When choosing a furniture style for your living room, consider your personal taste and the overall look and feel you want to create in your space.

What are the must-have furniture pieces for your dining room?
When it comes to designing a dining room, there are several must-have furniture pieces that can make it a functional and inviting space for family and guests to gather.
First and foremost, a dining table is the centrepiece of any dining room. Choose a table that fits the size of your room and your entertaining needs, and make sure it is comfortable to sit at for extended periods of time.
Chairs are also a crucial element, and should be both stylish and comfortable. A buffet or sideboard can provide additional storage and serving space, and can also be used to display decorative items.
Lighting is also important, and a chandelier or pendant light can add a touch of elegance to the room. Finally, a rug can help define the dining area and provide warmth and texture.
By incorporating these must-have furniture pieces, you can create a dining room that is both functional and stylish.
How do you choose the right dining room furniture for your space?
Choosing the right dining room furniture for your space can be a daunting task, but there are a few key factors to consider that can help make the decision easier.
First, consider the size of your dining room and the number of people you plan to accommodate. Choose a table and chairs that fit comfortably in the space and can accommodate your guests.
Next, think about your personal style and the overall aesthetic of your home. Choose furniture pieces that complement your existing decor and reflect your personal taste.
You should also consider the functionality of the furniture. Will you be using the space primarily for formal dinners, or do you need a more flexible setup for casual meals and entertaining?
Finally, set a budget and stick to it. With these factors in mind, you can choose the right dining room furniture that will meet your needs and enhance the overall look and feel of your home.
How do you style dining room furniture?
Styling dining room furniture involves creating a cohesive and inviting look that complements the overall aesthetic of your home. Start by choosing a focal point, such as a statement chandelier or piece of artwork, to anchor the room. Consider layering textures and colours with rugs, curtains, and table linens to add warmth and visual interest. Add decorative elements, such as wall art, candles, and greenery, to create a personalised touch. Don't be afraid to mix and match styles, but make sure each piece has a cohesive look and feel. With thoughtful styling, your dining room furniture can become a beautiful and functional space for gathering with family and friends.

Factory Buys offers Afterpay, which allows you to get exactly what you need now and pay it off in more manageable pieces. There are no credit checks or contracts, just the easiest way to give your office the furniture it needs to keep your business on track.

With the amount of time that many spend in the office, a comfortable chair isn't just a luxury, it's a necessity. When you're sitting down for 40+ hours a week it can take a toll on your body - specifically, your back. Getting the right chair isn't just an investment in your comfort but your health too. The wrong chair can do a tremendous amount of damage, creating tension and strain in the most innocuous way. Some of our office chairs even come with a massage feature to help increase circulation, stimulate muscle movement, relieve tension and improve productivity. Ensure you’re taking care of yourself even in the workplace with desks, office furniture, and perhaps even a sit-stand desk from Factory Buys.

What is a Queen Bed Frame?
A bed frame is a structure designed to support your mattress. It’s different from a bed base, as it has its own unique components. Unlike the regular box-shaped bed base, a bed frame has four legs, a foundation, and either bed slats or a mesh to hold the mattress. While most of the time, the foundation and mattress are elevated off the ground, there are bed frames that maximise space by boasting built-in storage solutions.
Queen bed frames can accommodate queen-size mattresses. They best suit master bedrooms and can provide restful sleep to up to two people — often, regardless of body type.
What Size is a Queen Bed Frame?
In Australia, a standard queen bed frame is designed to fit a queen mattress, which measures 153 cm in width and 203 cm in length. Hence, a queen size bed frame will have a slightly larger dimension. This is not only to cater to the mattress but also other features like headboards.
At Factory Buys, our queen bed frames are available in various dimensions. For instance, we have leather bed frames or bed frames with gas lift storage that measure 162 cm x 98 cm x 215 cm. Meanwhile, our fabric bed frames have a dimension of 160 cm x 89 cm x 250 cm.
We also have wooden frames that measure 165 cm x 94 cm x 218 cm. As another option, we have metal bed frames measuring 159 cm x 83 cm x 212 cm.
Will a Queen Mattress Fit on a Queen Bed Frame?
Yes. As mentioned, a queen bed frame is specifically designed for a queen mattress. As with any other bed frame, this compatibility ensures that you get a good night’s sleep. Plus, there’s a bit of extra space in the frame to accommodate your bedding (or overhang, if you choose to have one). This helps keep your mattress stable and your bedroom setup cosy and stylish.
Do I Need a Queen or Double Bed?
While browsing through queen beds for sale, you might wonder if this bed size is really the right size for you and your room. Queen bed frames are often compared to double bed frames, which are another popular choice for sizes. Double bed frames are made to accommodate double mattresses, whose standard Australian size is 137 cm x 190 cm.
Compared to a double bed frame, a queen bed frame is wider and longer. Double bed frames’ compactness is ideal for smaller rooms (usually guest rooms). They can sleep one adult, though in some cases, couples with not-too-large body types also prefer this size. Another upside of double beds is that they are relatively more affordable.
However, if you want something to give you an overall better sleep experience, queen bed frames are the way to go. They’re better for most adults and couples. As they are a highly in-demand bed frame size, you can easily find a material and style that suits your preferences.
What Styles Does Factory Buys Sell?
At Factory Buys, you can find a wide selection of cheap queen bed frames — and buy the best one for you in a few clicks and taps. In terms of style, we have options with luxurious materials, such as velvet and fabric. These bed frames boast elegant designs, complete with plush and tufted headboards.
If you’re going for a more natural look, we also have wooden bed frames. For a more modern style, our metal and fabric bed frames are for you. As stated, we also have beds with drawers and gas lift storage for a more practical approach. Want to jazz up your room? Opt for our poster bed frames or LED bed frames.

Shop Queen Bed Heads Online
Explore the stunning range of queen bed headboards, with styles, colours and fabrics to suit every bedroom’s aesthetic. Designed to be easy to attach to your queen bed, shop the collection at Factory Buys and find the perfect addition to your queen bed.
What Size Headboard Is a Queen Bed?
The size of queen headboards can vary slightly, depending on the style and shape you choose. The collection at Factory Buys will be at least as wide as your bed itself, measuring in at a minimum of 153cm in width. The apex of the headboard is slightly more variable, coming in different heights. They’re tall enough that you can comfortably lean against them if you’re sitting up and reading in bed while also coming in different shapes. Opt for traditional square corners, or choose a soft and curved style for a more modern look.
Can You Use a King Headboard on a Queen Bed?
While you could technically place a king bed head behind your queen bed, the dimensions don’t match up as well. Firstly, they are significantly wider than a queen-sized headboard, measuring 196cm wide, meaning you’ll have an extra 20cm of overhang on either side of your bed. This can clash with your bedside tables and make the room look slightly less cohesive.
Second, you’ll also need to adjust the way you affix your king bedhead to a queen-size bed, as the attachments won’t line up as cleanly. We recommend pairing your queen bed frame with the matching bedhead size.
What Materials Do the Queen Bed Heads Come in?
Our range of queen bed headboards comes in a range of fabrics. Explore the range that includes opulent velvet, modern and textural boucle, faux linen for a European feel and rattan for a rustic coastal charm. If you prefer a more resilient option, you can also get MDF timber head boards with shelving to add more space and utility to your bedroom in a stylish and understated way.
Cultivate a calming atmosphere in your bedroom by complementing your queen headboard with similar fabrics. Or, make a bolder statement by contrasting different fabrics, styles and patterns with your quilt cover or a throw blanket.
What Colours Do the Queen Bed Heads Come in?
Our range of queen-sized headboards includes a spectrum of neutral shades. They’re the perfect base to use as a focal point in your bedroom and can be paired easily with a range of different colours to suit your stylistic preferences.
For a more moody, contemporary look, explore the range of darker shades. These include light, smoky greys through to dark charcoal tones, which are perfect for creating a restful atmosphere. Dark shades are also perfect to make larger rooms feel more cosy and welcoming.
If you prefer more light and airy shades for your bedroom, you can choose from warm or neutral creams and the natural woody tones of rattan. These are perfect options for smaller rooms to make them feel more open and spacious but also create a more crisp and fresh look for your bed.
What Style Queen Bed Heads Are Available?
You can find a range of styles that are as comprehensive and broad as colour and fabric choices. Opt for the classic, timeless, tufted look with a quilted headboard to suit everything from art deco bedrooms to bohemian-style homes.
If you prefer something a little more rustic and textural, rattan is the perfect choice to add warmth to your space. Or, go for a darker and more moody timber look that’s more modern, coming with built-in shelving to add convenient storage.
What Other Queen Bed Accessories Does Factory Buys Sell?
You can get everything you need to create the bed of your dreams that’ll give you a restful night’s sleep while also enhancing the style of your bedroom. Explore the range of bed frames and queen mattresses, and then bring the look together by adding the perfect bedding.

What is a Double Bed Frame?
You need a double bed frame to support a double mattress. Generally speaking, a bed frame is that part of your bed setup that holds your mattress and bears other components, like the box spring, headboard, and footboard.
When you search for cheap double bed frames, you’ll find them in various styles and materials. Apart from the traditional bed frame — a straightforward structure with four legs and a headboard and footboard — you’ll encounter iterations of this furniture with built-in drawers. There are also four poster bed frames that add an interesting charm to your space.
What Size is a Double Bed Frame?
A bed frame is usually slightly larger than the mattress it’s designed to support. In the case of a bed frame double, it’s a double mattress. In Australia, this mattress typically measures 137 cm x 190 cm.
At Factory Buys, we offer double beds that measure very close to these dimensions and others that allow for more space. For example, we have a wooden bed frame that measures 147 cm in width, 82 cm in height, and 200 cm in depth, while another could be 148 cm wide, 100 cm high, and 198 cm deep. We also have metal and faux linen fabric bed frames that are more compact and sleek at 138 cm x 113 cm x 190 cm.
These examples illustrate the range of sizes available in our catalogue. If anything, they underscore our dedication to providing different dimensions to suit various preferences and room sizes.
Will a Double Mattress Fit on a Double Bed Frame?
Yes, double mattresses are perfectly suited for double bed frames. When furnishing and setting up your bedroom, make sure that you get the right size for your mattress and bed.
When you shop at Factory Buys, you can find other bed frame sizes that accommodate specific mattresses. These include:
Do I Need a Double or Queen Bed?
Whether you need a double bed frame or a queen-size one depends on various things — including the size of your room, how many are sleeping in it, and sleeping habits.
If you have a small bedroom, a double bed is for you. It can provide ample space for solo sleepers or even for couples who don’t need plenty of room. If you have a larger bedroom, consider a queen bed. It’s also the bed frame size suitable for couples or individuals who like extra room to move around.
Since double beds are smaller than queen beds, they are usually more affordable. So, if your budget is a concern, then a double bed is the more practical option.
Beds are usually the main visual element of a bedroom. At Factory Buys, our selection offers a diverse range of bed frame styles to suit various tastes and bedroom aesthetics.
Our collection of wooden bed frames — available in various finishes, like oak, pine timber, and white — is perfect if you want to achieve that classic, inviting look. If you’re looking for something with a modern touch, our sleek and stylish metal bed frames are for you. We have metal bunk beds and four poster beds as well.
Fabric and leather bed frames are ideal if you want to incorporate a luxurious feel into your personal sanctuary. Make your room feel more contemporary with LED bed frames.
We also have bed frames with taller headboards if you want a more eye-catching bed while having something to offer support when you’re watching TV or reading. As mentioned, we also have bed frames with drawers and gas-lift storage if you want to maximise your space.
Though we offer a double bed frame cheap at Factory Buys, we stand by the quality of every product we sell. So, no matter your style preference, you can have a durable yet affordable bed frame that brings your bedroom vision to life.
