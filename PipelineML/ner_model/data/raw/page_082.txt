Royal Oak have been hand crafting traditional and contemporary furniture in the Yorkshire Dales for over 40 years and produce some of the finest furniture to be found. We welcome visitors to our showroom in Grassington, or you can contact us on 01756 753378 or sales@royaloakfurniture.co.uk
Our Craftsmen continue the centuries old tradition of choosing, understanding and fashioning timber to produce truly unique pieces of furniture which celebrate the beauty of wood. Only the best quality oak is used, originating from environmentally managed woodlands where sustainability is a prime concern.
We combine traditional skills and methods including mortice and tenon joints, dovetailed drawers, slot screwed drawer bottoms and floating panels in doors with modern machinery such as CNC Routers and speed sanders to produce our furniture.
As well as oak, which comes in a variety of colours and finishes, from natural clean oak to rich, deep and characterful Jacobean hand-planed oak, we use a variety of hardwoods including walnut, ash and maple.
Every item of our furniture is designed and made individually in our Dales based workshop so if you require something made to your own personal specifications we are more than happy to meet your requirements.
