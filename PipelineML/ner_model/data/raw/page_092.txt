In 1886 Charles Jensen did not set out to be a furniture retailer. In fact, he was a sailmaker, par excellence. His specialty: canvas sails for both pleasure and commercial craft. In 1921 Edward Lewis started a company in custom-made canvas awnings for residential as well as business use. It was not until 1932 that these two canvas craftsmen joined forces to become Jensen-Lewis, the premier maker of canvas awnings in New York City. Thus when the company began selling canvas furniture in 1964, it was a natural outgrowth of both Charles Jensen's and Edward Lewis' endeavors.
The Jensen-Lewis Furniture Store opened its doors in 1964 selling canvas sofas and chairs; but we quickly expanded our collections. Today our store is very contemporary and full of intelligently designed modern furniture - our line is international in scope. We are constantly introducing our customers to new and innovative styles of the highest quality; but when a design proves to be a classic we add it to our permanent collection.

It‚Äôs exactly this thoughtful blend of the new and the tried-and-true that makes Jensen-Lewis New York‚Äôs most exciting furniture store. We offer you this web site as an introduction to our store. Please come in and see for yourself. Our showroom in Manhattan totals over 15,000 square feet for a genuinely grand furniture shopping experience.
