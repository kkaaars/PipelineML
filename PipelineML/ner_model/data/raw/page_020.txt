This a loosely woven fabric that presents a variety of vivid colors. Though casual in feel, this fabric is crisp in tailoring. While it is not technically a performance fabric, it is a woven fabric with a high fabric abrasion resistance of 100,000 double rubs.
A classic basket weave pattern that creates complex tones of color by weaving soft heathered filling yarns. It is a performance linen-like fabric though casual in feel, this fabric is crisp in tailoring.
A textured woven performance fabric with subtle, varying colors woven in grove point pattern with luxuriously textured yarns. It marries old world design with new fiber technology to make an extremely versatile fabric, allowing for a multi-dimensional look.
A lustrous velvet weave with an enhanced texture in the pile to create a textured striation. This opulent fabric evokes the look of a silk velvet. It has a rich luster and supple hand creating a luxe look and a stylish option for adding a touch of glam.
A buttery soft fabric with a subtle sheen and soft hand for an elegant look. This is considered a performance fabric because it is 100,000 double rubs and is inherently waterproof with an easy clean ability.
A semi-aniline performance leather with a subtle luster and natural pebble grain that is consistent throughout the hide. The subtle sauvage adds depth of color, while offering a greater resistance to stains.
A fresh approach to Nubuck Leather with the qualities of a full-grain, semi-aniline product. It has a velvet-like nap, a soft buttery hand, and visible natural characteristics that will develop a beautiful patina over time.
An aniline Italian leather, Salerno features a smooth, matte finish with a subtle pull-up effect. The natural and unique characteristics of these hides, along with the combination of waxes and oils on the finishing process, give this leather an incredibly soft hand.
