What is an organic mattress and why is it better?
For the same reasons one might buy organic vegetables or milk, common mattresses are predominantly produced with high chemical content. Flame retardants are a normal additive on mainstream mattresses, an additive proven to cause cancer and reproductive toxicity. But that’s just the beginning, read more here.
Organic mattresses are made with organic and non-toxic materials instead of conventional and chemically questionable materials. Consumers are choosing organic mattresses as a way to avoid unnecessary exposure to these chemicals.
TY Fine Furniture carries a hand picked selection of the finest organic latex and wool mattresses and bedding on the market, made by Naturepedic in Ohio .

Handmade in Columbus
Solid Wood Artisan Furniture
T.Y. Fine Furniture was born in a humble basement workshop in Columbus Ohio in 2004 from an incurable passion to create timeless artisan furniture fueled by the joy of woodworking. The desire to furnish homes with beautiful, natural and useful art has been well received and has allowed T.Y. Fine Furniture grow into the business that we are today. With a 20,000sq ft workshop and a 6,000 sq ft furniture gallery our company has become home to a team of 10 extraordinary, fun and creative artisans that we call the TY family.
T.Y. Fine Furniture is a unique company in the fact that it grew entirely from sweat equity and a passionate love for timeless design and quality furniture. Solid Wood construction, traditional joinery and designing with multiple generations in mind are the fundamental tenants at TY. Every piece of furniture we make with care and precision. We hand finish each piece with our exclusive organic oil (designed by TY) and hard wax finish. We have watched fads come and go in the furniture industry for many years, yet our furniture remains the same, honest with clean lines and built for generations.
Our Founder (and fearless leader) Tarik Yousef is a Mechanical Engineering graduate from THE Ohio State University. He comes from a family of scholars and professors who also teach and study at Ohio State. After Graduating from Ohio State, Tarik joined the Honda Engineering Company to develop complex metal forming dies used in the production of Honda's vehicles. The environment at Honda left Tarik longing for a more personable and fulfilling life. Reflecting on the joy of his High School wood shop experience he began building artisan furniture during ALL his free time. It became evident this was his true love and calling. Stepping out in faith he created T.Y. Fine Furniture and he found that many people were tired of mass produced heartless furniture and were falling in love with his artisan authentic designs and quality. He is forever grateful for his following of faithful real furniture enthusiasts who helped fulfill his vision and build T.Y. Fine Furniture. This growth has allowed Tarik to hire like minded artisans as well as providing the opportunity to hire and mentor new artisans.
From our humble beginnings grew a company of passionate creative individuals committed to building and selling furniture of uncompromising quality for the best competitive value in our market today. Our team consists of artists, craftsmen, designers and engineers. We are extremely grateful to have a synergistic team of creative, caring individuals uniquely driven to provide the best possible quality, design, experience and value.
We know the furniture we create makes a home more beautiful, authentic and useful and will find its way into hearts and memories of families all over. Our gratitude extends to all our fans and friends (customers). Thanks to them and Tarik’s vision we have all found more personable and fulfilling work and consequently lives.

T.Y. Fine Furniture Collection
You can find our lovely showroom at North High Street, Clintonville, a relatively quiet commercial street that sits nearby a park. Inside, you can find our collection of fine furniture, designed by Tarik Yousef and passionate local craftsman. T.Y. Fine Furniture crafts all pieces by hand using traditional joinery and propriety construction methods. Moreover, each piece is completed with a signature, toxic and VOC free wood finish formulated from organic ingredients.
Aside from our T.Y. Fine Furniture, we also carry mattresses, bedding, recliners, couches, sleeper sofas, and other products from reputable brands. We also have artwork and pottery made by local artisans. Our curated collection only features brands that perfectly align with our vision.
Not only does T.Y. Fine Furniture create exquisite furniture, but we also offer some of the most luxurious mattresses you can find.
Naturepedic makes some of the best Organic Mattresses available. They are proudly made in Chagrin Falls Ohio, ensuring quality and supporting the local community. These mattresses are 100% organic, with no shortcuts or compromises.
The people behind Naturepedic understand that being the cheapest option isn't always the best, so they focus on providing customers with the greatest value. And to top it all off, every item comes with an impressive 20-year warranty, because they stand behind their products.
Aside from Naturepedic, we also have our very own line of tailor-fit luxury beds. Crafted with Natural European components and handmade in the USA, each mattress is tailor-fit to your body's unique needs, ensuring optimum support and luxurious sleep. We use the healthiest and most durable materials in the industry, guaranteeing a mattress that will last for years. And the best part? We can modify it until you find your perfect fit.
When a customer invests in a custom-made furniture piece or organic mattress from T.Y. Fine Furniture, we want to ensure that the purchase makes it to its final destination in one pristine piece.
Here’s a look at how our products get from here to there.
Okay, so first, it’s not exactly true to say we will appear at your door to bring your purchases wearing white gloves. But our approach to protecting your new purchase is demonstrated by several investments we have made in how we package and send those valuable items, regardless of whether their destination is down the street or halfway across the globe.
Local Deliveries - Columbus Ohio and Surrounding Areas
For local deliveries, our level of service supersedes anyone else’s. Our own staff brings your new furniture and mattresses to your home; we don’t subcontract the work to an outside firm. For example, when we deliver a new mattress, we take the time to inspect the existing bed frame not only to ensure it will support the new purchase but also to be certain it is safe and free from defects. New mattresses are assembled, as needed (depending on the type purchased) and we are happy to remove old bedding, so you don’t have to.
Our local customers shouldn’t be surprised if the person delivering their custom-made furniture is the actual craftsman who made it. That means they are well-suited to respond to questions regarding our products and believe me, it doesn’t take much to get us to talk about what we do!
Outside Central Ohio Shipments
We cater to our out-of-state customers just as much as our local ones. For example, items are boxed in triple-wall cardboard boxes specially designed to protect the wares you purchase. Those shipping boxes also contain as many as four layers of triple wall to protect key spots in the product being shipped. We also shy away from foam and plastic padding as much as possible, protecting everything with recyclable materials such as cardboard-based padding and inflatable air-filled cushions.
Our beds are also designed to come apart, making them easier to move into a home and lessening the challenges of shipping. The various bed frame parts are individually packaged so customers can simply bring them into their homes, should they opt for optional curbside delivery.
We also enclose extensive directions about the set-up and care of your new purchases. Of course, we are happy to chat with you to answer any questions you might have about how to assemble or care for your product (if that’s necessary). In other words, we are here for you before, during, and even after a sale.
Shipping Options Summary
Curbside: This is the most basic delivery option. The item will be carefully boxed and placed on a pallet. We use very heavy triple-wall cardboard boxes on everything. Beds are packed in their respective smaller parts and separated into several boxes for ease of handling. Assembly is very easy and directions are included. Our efforts are designed to make curbside deliveries both economical and easy for the customer.
Inside Delivery - Basic: This is simply a basic level delivery where the item can be brought into a garage or inside the front door. This is ideal in situations where you anticipate bad weather or perhaps you aren't available to accept the delivery yourself, perhaps a neighbor or family member is there to accept it.
Inside Delivery - Room of Choice: This is the same as curbside delivery with the exception that the delivery person will take the item into the room you choose to have it delivered to. It is still your responsibility to unpack and assemble as needed.
White Glove Delivery: This service level includes full-service delivery including all the services above, but also with unpacking and in some cases even furniture assembly. We do not offer this service level in all areas and it must be priced on a case-by-case basis. Due to COVID-19, we can not guarantee this service or guarantee the level of service available in your city. We encourage customers looking for this level of service to consider hiring a local moving company, handyman, or trusted individual to handle this level of service independently.
Current Shipping Rates and Lead times
Lead Time: Currently, most orders still ship in 4-6 weeks, although we always target 4 weeks and under. Shipping takes 5-10 business days for all basic services, typically 5 days is the average. White glove shipping can take up to 4 weeks.
Shipping Rates: Our current shipping is FREE on all items. This is subject to change without notice.
