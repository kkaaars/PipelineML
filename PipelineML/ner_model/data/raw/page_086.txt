We have been customers for over 13 years. Charlie has always gone above and beyond with great customer service! We recommend them to all our friends. Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom’s injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital. As always Charlie made it happen! Great store and great employees!!!!
I have shopped at Wayne’s Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture. Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!!
I found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors. Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit. I would definitely recommend Wayne's!!
By far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That’s the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched.
My husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne’s Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne’s Furniture- check them out. 5/5 stars for me
I was first introduced to Wayne’s furniture by my brother. Who only makes recommendations if he knows the company or person is reputable. Needless to say, Charlie and his staff did not disappoint. Even, with uncontrollable delivery delays they kept us updated on every step of the way. If you want quality furniture and good service use Waynes!!!
