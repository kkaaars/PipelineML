What is a console table used for?
These slender and tall tables are usually placed in entryways and hallways to provide a space for storage of small items as well as a display area for vases, lamps, and various homewares.
Why is it called a console table?
The console table is believed to have originated from the French word ‘consolide’ which means to make something stronger, as they were usually attached to walls using S brackets. Now console tables come in all shapes, styles, colours and sizes to suit your home.

What is the difference between an end table and a side table?
When it comes to furniture pieces, the terms "end table" and "side table" are often used interchangeably. While they are similar in function, there are some slight differences between the two. Typically, an end table is placed at the end of a sofa or beside a chair, while a side table can be used in various locations throughout a room. End tables are often taller than side tables, and they may have a drawer or shelf for additional storage. Side tables, on the other hand, are usually smaller and more portable, making them perfect for holding drinks or snacks while entertaining.
What can I use instead of a side table?
If you are looking for an alternative to a traditional side table, there are several options to consider. One option is to use a small bookshelf or a set of nesting tables. You can also repurpose an old trunk or suitcase as a unique and stylish side table. Another option is to use a floor lamp with a built-in table, which can provide both lighting and a functional surface. Don't be afraid to get creative and think outside the box when it comes to finding the perfect side table alternative for your space.
What are side tables in the living room called?
In the living room, side tables are sometimes referred to as accent tables or occasional tables. They are designed to provide a functional surface for drinks, snacks, or decorative items, while also adding style and visual interest to the room. Side tables can come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and materials, making it easy to find one that complements your existing decor.
How high should a side table be next to a sofa?
The height of your side table can make a big difference in both the function and aesthetics of your space. As a general rule, your side table should be approximately the same height as the armrest of your sofa or chair. This will ensure that the table is easy to reach from a seated position and that it looks visually balanced next to your furniture. Keep in mind that the height of your sofa or chair arms may vary, so be sure to measure carefully before selecting your side table.
